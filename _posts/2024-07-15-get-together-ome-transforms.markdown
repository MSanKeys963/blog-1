# Join the 3rd Get Your Brain Together Hackathon!

Join us for third edition of the [Get Your Brain Together] Hackathon! This exciting event invites neuroimage data generators, image registration researchers, and neurodata compute infrastructure providers to come together for a hands-on, collaborative experience. [Register] now and be part of this vibrant community working towards creating reproducible, open-source resources that unlock the mysteries of brain structure and function.

This hackathon will focus on **advancing [OME-Zarr] spatial transformations**.

## Overview of OME-Zarr

[OME-Zarr] is a cloud-optimized bioimaging file format that enjoys international community support and widespread adoption in neuroscience. It supports large-scale bioimages with spatial metadata, making it a critical tool for scientific research. The current OME-Zarr standard is enhanced by the [coordinate transformations draft], which introduces robust support for spatial transformations. This is particularly important for neuroimaging and other scientific imaging practices, as it facilitates:

- **Reproducibility and Consistency:** Explicit support for spatial transformations ensures consistent application across various platforms and applications. This feature aligns with the [FAIR] principles, enabling independent researchers to verify results.
- **Integration with Analysis Workflows:** By treating spatial transformations as a first-class entity within file formats, OME-Zarr allows seamless integration with diverse image analysis workflows, eliminating the need for additional conversion steps.
- **Efficiency and Accuracy:** Embedding transformations within the file format minimizes the need for re-sampling, thereby reducing sampling errors and preserving analysis accuracy. This standardization is crucial for handling the massive data volumes generated by modern microscopy techniques.
- **Flexibility in Analysis:** Native support for spatial transformations provides researchers with the flexibility to apply, modify, or reverse transformations as needed, facilitating longitudinal studies, multi-modal imaging, and comparative analysis.

## Hackathon Agenda

The hackathon is structured into three key components:

1. **Day 1:** Tutorial sessions covering the application needs for coordinate transformations, mathematical principles, and current computational standards and tools available in the open-source ecosystem.
2. **Day 2:** Small working groups will review and propose enhancements to the current coordinate transformations draft and relevant neuroimaging additions.
3. **Day 3:** Hands-on activities where participants will implement and apply the proposed improvements to the standards.

## Event Details

- **Dates:** Friday, July 26th - Sunday, July 28th, 2024
- **Location:** Hybrid event at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, via Google Meet videoconferencing, Image.sc Island Gather.Town virtual space, and Image.sc Zulip Chat.
- **Cost:** [Registration] is free!
