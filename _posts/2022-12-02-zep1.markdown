The Zarr community is working on a new version of Zarr, v3, which was drafted
and proposed via [ZEP 1] by [Alistair Miles]. [Jonathan Striebel] and
[Jeremy Maitin-Shepard] have now taken over the authorship of [ZEP 1].

The spec is now being finalized and **needs your feedback** before the Zarr
Steering Council and the Zarr Implementor's Council vote on it. In two weeks,
(on the 19th of December), the spec will go into feature-freeze, meaning only
changes (issues) that have been previously discussed will be incorporated. The
documents in question are:

* [Zarr enhancement proposal for v3 (ZEP 1)](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0001.html) (motivation and context)
* [Current draft of the v3 specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/v3.0.html) (actual spec)

If you are familiar with v2, you might want to start at the
[comparison with v2 section of the specs](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/v3.0.html#comparison-with-zarr-v2).

Please feel free to:

* add to the current discussions in [issues on the project board](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/projects/2/views/2),
* open [pull requests for changes](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/blob/main/docs/core/v3.0.rst), or
* [add new issues](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/new) if your topic does not fit any existing ones.
