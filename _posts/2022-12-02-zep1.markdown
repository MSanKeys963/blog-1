The Zarr community is working on a new version of Zarr, V3, which was drafted
and proposed via [ZEP0001] by [Alistair Miles]. We, [Jonathan Striebel] and
[Jeremy Maitin-Shepard], have now taken over the authorship of [ZEP0001].

The specification is now being finalized and **needs your feedback** before the [Zarr
Steering Council] and the [Zarr Implementation Council] vote on it. In two weeks,
(on the [19th of December](https://howlongagogo.com/date/2022/december/19)), the spec will go into feature-freeze, meaning only
changes (issues) that have been previously discussed will be incorporated. The
documents in question are:

* [Zarr Enhancement Proposal for V3 (ZEP0001)](https://zarr.dev/zeps/draft/ZEP0001.html)
> Motivation and Context

* [Current draft of the V3 Specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/v3.0.html) 
> The Actual Spec

If you are familiar with V2, you might want to start at the
[comparison with V2 section of the specs](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/v3.0.html#comparison-with-zarr-v2).

Please feel free to:

* Add to the current discussions in [issues on the project board](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/projects/2/views/2),
* Open [pull requests for changes](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/blob/main/docs/core/v3.0.rst), or
* [Add new issues](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/new) if your topic does not fit any existing ones.
