Hi, Zarr Community! 👋🏻

We've got an exiciting announcement for you all! 😄

## Community Update: Moving to Zulip 💬

We're excited to announce that the Zarr community has made a significant move
from [Gitter](https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/community) to [Zulip](https://ossci.zulipchat.com/)
as our primary chat platform. This transition marks a new chapter for our
community and offers several advantages for our members.

## Why Zulip? 🤔

Zulip offers a robust and versatile platform for communication and
collaboration. Its threading model allows for organized and focused
discussions, making it easier for community members to follow and participate
in conversations effectively. Additionally, Zulip provides powerful search
capabilities, ensuring that valuable information shared in the past remains
accessible to all.

## Hosting Thanks 🙏🏻

We extend our sincere gratitude to the good humans at the [Open Source Science
Initiative](https://opensource.science/) (OSSCi) for generously hosting the
Zulip server. Their commitment to supporting open science and collaborative
research is commendable, and we're thrilled to partner with them on this
endeavour. 

Shoutout to [Jonathan Starr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-starr-b04032284/)
for helping us! 🙌🏻

## Building a Hub for Open Science 🧬

The OSSCi Zulip server will serve as a hub for various projects under the
scientific Python ecosystem, starting with Zarr. By centralising communication
within this platform, we aim to foster greater collaboration, knowledge
sharing, and community building among like-minded individuals passionate about
open science and research.

## Official Chat Platform ™️

With this migration, the OSSCi Zulip server becomes the official chat platform
for the Zarr community. We encourage all Zarr users, contributors, and
enthusiasts to join us on Zulip to stay updated on the latest developments,
seek assistance, and engage with fellow community members.

## Your Feedback Matters 🔁

At Zarr, we value the input and ideas of our community members. We're committed
to continuously improving our platform and user experience. Therefore, we
welcome any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you may have regarding the Zulip
migration or any other aspect of our community. Your input helps us better
serve the needs of our users and advance our shared goals.
