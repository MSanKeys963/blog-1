## Hi again, Outreachies! 🙋🏻‍♂️

It’s been more than a week since the [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Contribution Phase opened, and we’ve been actively engaging with the applicants through our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/outreachy-contributors-dec-2022), [GitHub issues](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues), [PRs](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pulls) etc.

If you haven't read the first blog post, please check it here: [https://zarr.dev/blog/outreachy-contributor-guide/](https://zarr.dev/blog/outreachy-contributor-guide/).

> We’re so happy and excited to see the enthusiasm of the applicants, and sometimes it’s been hard to keep up with all of the queries and messages (sort of a good thing). :)

We were going through the existing PRs and thought of finding an additional way to contribute to Zarr and engage them better with the Zarr community. So we came up with the idea of [#beautifulzarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/beautiful-zarr). 

### What is [#beautifulzarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/beautiful-zarr)?

It is a repository under [zarr-developers](https://github.com/zarr-developers/) GitHub, which would host beautiful use cases, visualisations, code snippets, screenshots and Twitter/social media mentions of [#zarr](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23zarr&src=typed_query) and Zarr data.

We couldn’t think of a better time to start the compilation of fantastic work the community is doing with the help of Zarr. We plan to build and evolve this repository over time and curate its contents on our homepage.

> How can you contribute to [#beautifulzarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/beautiful-zarr)?

- Fork the [repository](https://github.com/zarr-developers/beautiful-zarr), create a new folder inside the [_data](https://github.com/zarr-developers/beautiful-zarr/tree/main/_data) folder and name it your GitHub username. It should look like this `_data/<YOUR-USERNAME>`. Ex.
    `_data/MSanKeys963/`

- Browse the vast internet 🌏 (WWW) and find how the community uses Zarr for their work. Try to capture their work in screenshots, code snippets (along with visualisations), use cases, and mentions on Twitter/social media ([#zarr](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23zarr&src=typed_query) or similar). Add your result in a `.md` file in the folder created above. Ex.
    `_data/MSanKeys963/README.md`

- Submit a [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). The maintainers for this repo will review your PR and then merge it.

> Here are some tips to get you started:

→ Tip 1: A few code snippets show how easy it is to visualise Zarr data. Check [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RTryIn59P8Kc_TxlnFlaJpCB8Hf4_U09?usp=sharing). 💡

→ Tip 2: Check out the [MSanKeys963's folder](https://github.com/zarr-developers/beautiful-zarr/tree/main/_data/MSanKeys963) and [README.md](https://github.com/zarr-developers/beautiful-zarr/blob/main/_data/MSanKeys963/README.md) to get some inspiration! 🌳

Once your PR is accepted and merged, you’ve successfully passed the Outreachy contribution phase. 🎉

Now you have to wait for the final results, or you can start working on additional issues to increase your chances of selection. Please refer to the first blog [here](https://zarr.dev/blog/outreachy-contributor-guide/) for additional work. 🤞🏻

If you have any queries during the contribution phase, don’t hesitate to ask them in the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/outreachy-contributors-dec-2022). We’re here to help you!

Happy Contributing! ✌🏻
